## Building process

The JS can be minified and optimized by [require js optimizer](http://www.requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#download).

* You have to download it (see links),
* And launch the command `r.js -o ./DOCUMENT/IHM/build.js`
* The JS will be concatened, minified and a source map generated
